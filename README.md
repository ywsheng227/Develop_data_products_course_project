# Develop_data_products_course_project
This Shiny app predicts the miles per galon (mpg) of vehicles based on their number of cylinders, displacement, weight, and type of transmission. The program builds a generalized linear model (glm) from the built-in dataset `mtcars`.

## Layout of the Web App
1. The input panels are located on the left.
2. The output panel is located on the right.

## How-to-Use Instructions
1. The default values will be displayed on the input and output panels. To change the number of cylinders, displacement, and weight, type in new value or press up/down on the right side of the text box. 
2. Press `Submit` button. The new predicted mpg will be displaced on the right.
